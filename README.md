# Plane MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for
[Plane](https://plane.so). Gives an AI agent tools to read and manage projects,
work items, cycles, modules, releases, customers and more.

Built on [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) and the official
[`plane-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/plane-sdk/).

- **30 tools**, one per Plane resource, covering 204 operations
- **Local or remote** — stdio, streamable HTTP, SSE
- **OAuth or API key** authentication

## Quick start

Get an API key from Plane: **Workspace Settings → API tokens**.

Add this to your MCP client's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["plane-mcp-server", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "PLANE_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
        "PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "<your-workspace-slug>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`uvx` needs no install step. Requires Python 3.10+.

For a self-hosted Plane, add `"PLANE_BASE_URL": "https://plane.example.com"`.

## Transports

### stdio — local

Runs as a subprocess of your MCP client. Configuration as shown above; needs
`PLANE_API_KEY` and `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG`.

```bash
PLANE_API_KEY=... PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=... uvx plane-mcp-server stdio
```

### HTTP with OAuth — hosted

`https://mcp.plane.so/http/mcp`

The OAuth flow is handled on connect; no credentials in your config. For clients
without native remote MCP support, bridge with `mcp-remote`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.plane.so/http/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Node.js 22+.

### HTTP with a personal access token — hosted

`https://mcp.plane.so/http/api-key/mcp`

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <PAT>` |
| `X-Workspace-slug` | `<workspace-slug>` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.plane.so/http/api-key/mcp"],
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <PAT>",
        "X-Workspace-slug": "<workspace-slug>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT Web with No Auth — private single-workspace gateway

Generate a separate capability; do not reuse the Plane PAT:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Supply `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `PLANE_API_KEY`, and `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG` from
container or orchestrator secrets. Configure the ChatGPT connector as **No
Auth** with:

```
https://mcp.example.com/http/chatgpt/<MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN>/mcp
```

These variables are additive to an existing HTTP deployment. The `http`
process still constructs the OAuth transport, so it still needs the deployment's
normal HTTP/OAuth configuration, including `PLANE_OAUTH_PROVIDER_*`; the gateway
values do not replace it.

If `MCP_PATH_PREFIX` is set, include it before `/http` in this URL. The Plane
PAT remains server-side. The URL itself is a credential: require HTTPS, do not
share it, redact `/http/chatgpt/*` in proxy access logs, use a least-privilege
Plane token, and rotate `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` if the URL leaks. Prefer OAuth for
per-user identity and revocation.

The Plane PAT and gateway capability never belong in MCP responses or
application logs. `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG` is fixed server-side for routing and
cannot be overridden by connector headers, but it is not treated as an
authentication secret: valid Plane resources returned by tools may naturally
include the workspace slug. If the workspace name itself must remain
confidential, use OAuth and/or an output policy.

The container listens on port 8211. For example, these Docker/Traefik labels
only forward HTTPS traffic to it; they deliberately do not inject
`Authorization` or `X-Workspace-slug`:

```yaml
labels:
  - traefik.enable=true
  - traefik.http.routers.plane-mcp.rule=Host(`mcp.example.com`)
  - traefik.http.routers.plane-mcp.entrypoints=websecure
  - traefik.http.routers.plane-mcp.tls=true
  - traefik.http.services.plane-mcp.loadbalancer.server.port=8211
```

The server disables its own HTTP access log, but this does not disable a
reverse proxy's access log. Configure Traefik access logging to exclude this
router, or redact the capability path in the deployment logging pipeline;
per-router access-log configuration differs by Traefik version.

### SSE — deprecated

`https://mcp.plane.so/sse` is maintained for backward compatibility only. Use an
HTTP transport instead.

## Tools

The server advertises 30 tools, one per resource. Each takes an `action`
parameter that selects the operation:

```python
workitem(action="create", project_id=..., name="Fix login")
workitem(action="list", project_id=..., pql='state__group = "started"')
cycle(action="archive", project_id=..., cycle_id=...)
```

Every tool's description lists its actions with their required and optional
parameters, so the catalogue is self-documenting at call time.

**→ [Full tool and action reference](plane_mcp/tools/README.md)**

### Querying work items

List, count and search accept **PQL**, Plane's query language:

```python
workitem(action="list", project_id=..., pql='state__group = "started" AND priority = "urgent"')
workitem(action="count", pql='assignees__id = "<member id>"', group_by="state_id")
```

Call `get_pql_reference` for the full syntax, operators and worked examples.

### Upgrading from the per-operation tools

Earlier releases exposed one tool per API operation. **Existing integrations keep
working**: 169 of those 177 names still resolve to the consolidated tool, so a
saved prompt or script calling `create_work_item` or `list_cycles` needs no
change. They are no longer advertised, and they keep the parameter names they
shipped with (`work_item_id`, not `workitem_id`).

Seven names chose between two operations with a parameter
(`manage_project_archive(archive=False)`), which one tool-and-action pair cannot
reproduce; calling one tells you its replacement. `get_pql_reference` is
unchanged.

## Configuration

### Authentication

| Variable | Required for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PLANE_API_KEY` | stdio; ChatGPT no-auth gateway | API key; server-side Plane credential for the gateway |
| `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG` | stdio; ChatGPT no-auth gateway | Target workspace; server-side gateway workspace |
| `MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | ChatGPT no-auth gateway | At least 32 characters from `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`; setting it activates startup validation and requires both Plane values |
| `PLANE_BASE_URL` | optional | Plane API URL (default `https://api.plane.so`) |

The OAuth and PAT remote transports carry credentials in the connection — the
OAuth flow or the PAT headers — and need none of these as caller credentials.
When the gateway is added to the same `http` process, its three variables are
additional configuration; construction of the existing OAuth app still needs
the HTTP deployment's `PLANE_OAUTH_PROVIDER_*` settings.

Self-hosting the server itself:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PLANE_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` | Internal URL for server-to-server calls, preferred over `PLANE_BASE_URL` |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PORT` | OAuth token storage; falls back to in-memory |
| `PLANE_OAUTH_PROVIDER_*` | OAuth client credentials and base URL |
| `MCP_PATH_PREFIX` | Path prefix for the HTTP routes, when mounted behind a proxy — `/plane` serves `/plane/http/mcp` |

### OAuth redirect URIs

The OAuth transports validate each client's redirect URI against an allowlist.
Common clients (Cursor, VS Code, Claude.ai, ChatGPT connectors, localhost) are
allowed by default.

To onboard a new client without a release, append patterns:

```bash
export PLANE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS="https://newclient.com/cb,https://other.app/oauth/*"
```

`*` matches any port, path segment or subdomain. Keep the host pinned and
wildcard only the port or path.

### Logging

Structured JSON. Each tool call logs its name, duration, status and — when
available — an opaque user id and the workspace slug.

```bash
export LOG_USER_INFO=false    # also log the display name (PII);
export LOG_PAYLOADS=false    # keep request payloads out of logs; default true
```

Only the OAuth and PAT transports carry a display name; stdio is unaffected.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makeplane/plane-mcp-server
cd plane-mcp-server
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the server against a workspace:

```bash
PLANE_API_KEY=... PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=... python -m plane_mcp stdio
python -m plane_mcp http            # port 8211
```

Tests, format, lint:

```bash
pytest                              # no network or credentials needed
ruff format plane_mcp/ tests/       # line length 120
ruff check plane_mcp/ tests/        # rules E, F, I, UP, B
```

The suite runs fully offline — every action of every resource is
executed against a stand-in that binds each call against the genuine `plane-sdk`
signature. See [`plane_mcp/tools/README.md`](plane_mcp/tools/README.md#tests).

Live integration tests are skipped unless you point them at a running server:

```bash
export PLANE_TEST_API_KEY=... PLANE_TEST_WORKSPACE_SLUG=...
export PLANE_TEST_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8211    # optional; this is the default
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

They write real data to that workspace.
